I am excited to apply for \textbf{<POSITION>}.
\textbf{
  State the position you are applying for, how you found out about it,
  and ask for consideration based on your skills and experiences you
  have to offer.
  If you were referred by someone, state that here.
  (i.e.: someone you know at the company, a recruiter you met at a
  career fair, etc.)
  Make a general statement summarizing what qualifies you most for the job.
}

My main interest is mathematical modelling of complex systems,
and I worked as a research scientist in computational neuroscience
during my studies.
The main focus of my research has been understanding how the brain
works by using Machine Learning and AI,
and working on understanding how AI models process data.
I have build data analysis pipelines from scratch to process brain imaging data,
and have build animal behavior models using AI that replicated animal behavior.
I have a strong background in mathematics and physics, and have
strong programming skills.
I am comfortable working in both low level and high level coding environments;
having experience building AI models from scratch and using well
established codebases.

A valuable skill I bring is communicating to a wide audience.
During my academic studies, I had to collaborate across different
fields and cultures.
I am able to work across technical divides and communicate with colleagues.
This often allowed me to be the bridge between my advisor and other
laboratory members in communicating deliverables,
and I created a collaborative environment.
Having worked in Quantitative Neuroscience while having a Physics
background also allowed me to develop technical communication skills.
I often was in a position where there was a skill gap between my
laboratory and our collaborator's skills; in math and biology.
I developed the skills to communicate the needed technical details to
people of different backgrounds.

I am very excited to apply for the \textbf{<POSITION>}.
I would greatly appreciate thge oppurtunity for an interview.
If I can provide further details, feel free to contact me.
Thank you for your time and consideration.
