The mission of Inductive Bio is very exciting to me.
My main scientific interest is modelling complex systems using ML to
obtain deeper understanding of such systems.
It's very exciting to see Inductive Bio bring this aspect to
computational chemistry.

During my research at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, I was in
Koulakov Laboratory where our
main focus was on olfaction.
While I haven't seen this discussed within the olfaction community often,
I developed the sense that drug discovery and olfaction is deeply linked.
Both of these fields require modelling of receptor-to-chemical interactions.
Working out the dimensionality of chemicals is highly complex, and
the reason why olfaction is still an unsolved sense. (As opposed to
sight or hearing.)

The most interesting research to come out of the Koulakov Laboratory,
in my opinion, is
DeepNose~\cite{deepnose};
an encoder-decoder neural network that runs convolution on 3D images
of molecules to predict smell percepts of chemicals.
While I did not work directly in this project due to my grant obligations,
I was involved with discussions on the architecture and the
implementation of this project.
I always believed the encoding of DeepNose would contain
information that is crucial to predict receptor-to-chemical interactions.
This was demonstrated when DeepNose's architecture was very
successful in predicting water solubility in early stages of testing
the network.
Inductive Bio is working on this problem, and I would love the
oppurtunity to pursue this line of practical research.

I would love to hear more about Inductive Bio, and believe my
experience in building and deploying ML on similar problembs could be valuable.
My degree is in physics, and while I worked in a very
interdisciplinary lab during my research,
my main background is a strong understanding of mathematics.
I have a deep love for modelling complex dynamical systems, and my strong
grasp of linear algebra transfers really well to ML.
I am also well versed in communicating scientists of varying
backgrounds, having collaborated with scientists and engineers in an
interdisciplinary environment.

Thank you for your time and consideration.
