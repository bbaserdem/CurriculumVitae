I am excited to apply for the Senior Data Scientist position at Arcadia.
I believe the set of skills I cultivated make me a great fit for this
job position.

I have done research in ML and AI for my Ph.D. degree, and I
extensively coded in Python and MATLAB, and coded in R as well.
Data analysis and the mathematical models that build ML has been part
of my education, and I am strong in both application and theory of
these methods.
A lot of my studies focused on simulating and studying time series
and dynamical systems.
In my free time, I have been working with Generative AI models and
LLMs, and been learning how to fine tune them.

My main interest is mathematical modelling of complex systems,
and I worked as a research scientist in computational neuroscience
during my studies.
I have build data analysis pipelines from scratch to process brain imaging data,
and have build animal behavior models using AI that replicated animal behavior.
I am comfortable working in both low level and high level coding environments;
having experience building AI models from scratch and using well
established codebases, such as PyTorch.
I think my ability to apply ML to novel environments such as animal
behavior is a great asset for this job position.

A unique skill I bring is communicating to a wide audience.
During my academic studies, I had to collaborate across different
fields and cultures.
I am able to work across technical divides and communicate with colleagues.
This often allowed me to be the bridge between my advisor and other
laboratory members in communicating deliverables,
and I created a collaborative environment.
Having worked in Quantitative Neuroscience while having a Physics
background also allowed me to develop technical communication skills.
I often was in a position where there was a skill gap between my
laboratory and our collaborator's skills; in math and biology.
I developed the skills to communicate the needed technical details to
people of different backgrounds.

I would greatly appreciate the opportunity for an interview.
If I can provide further details, feel free to contact me.
Thank you for your time and consideration.
